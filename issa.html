<h1>For Issa 🎄</h1>

<p>
You feel like laughter without limits,<br>
Silly joy and fearless smiles.<br>
You bring light just by being you,<br>
Turning moments warm and wild.
</p>

<p>
Funny in ways that feel so free,<br>
Kind at heart, effortlessly.<br>
You care deeply, you love out loud,<br>
Comfortable standing in every crowd.
</p>

<p>
There’s beauty in your confidence,<br>
In knowing who you are and staying true.<br>
You show the world it’s okay to shine,<br>
To take up space, to just be you.
</p>

<p>
You make life brighter, softer too,<br>
Just by being exactly who you are.<br>
And that kind of joy, that kind of light,<br>
Is something truly special to carry.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>
