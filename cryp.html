<h1>For Bubba 🎄</h1>

<p>
You stand beside me, steady and strong,<br>
Protecting me quietly all along.<br>
You watch, you listen, you always care,<br>
Making sure I’m safe, making sure I’m there.
</p>

<p>
You carry wisdom in the way you speak,<br>
Strong and brave, yet gentle, not weak.<br>
When things feel heavy and I feel small,<br>
You remind me I don’t face it all.
</p>

<p>
You look out for me without needing praise,<br>
A constant light through difficult days.<br>
Talented, thoughtful, intelligent too,<br>
I feel safer just knowing you do.
</p>

<p>
You make sure I’m okay, no matter the cost,<br>
And because of you, I’m never lost.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>

<div class="letter">
  <p><strong>Hi, Bubba.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Thank you so much for being there for me.
    Thank you for steering me in the right direction and making sure that I do the right thing.
    Thank you for believing in me.
    You’re so intelligent, brave, and talented.
  </p>

  <p>
    You look out for me in ways that feel quiet but constant.
    You make sure I’m okay without ever making me feel small.
    When I’m unsure or scared, you ground me.
    When I doubt myself, you remind me who I am and what I’m capable of.
  </p>

  <p>
    You carry so much wisdom and strength, and you wear it with kindness.
    You don’t just protect me, you teach me.
    You show me what it means to be strong without being harsh,
    and caring without expecting anything in return.
  </p>

  <p>
    Knowing you’re there makes the world feel less scary.
    It makes me feel safe.
    It makes me feel like no matter what happens,
    I won’t be facing it alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for loving me the way you do.<br>
    Thank you for watching over me.<br>
    Thank you for being the best cg and the best big brother.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Love,</strong><br>
    your Little One 🤍
