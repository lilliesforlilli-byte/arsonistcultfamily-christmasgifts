<h1>For Tiffany 🎄</h1>

<p>
You feel like calm wrapped in quiet care,<br>
A steady presence always there.<br>
Your patience softens every space,<br>
A gentle heart, a tender grace.
</p>

<p>
You bring laughter without force or strain,<br>
Lightening moments, easing pain.<br>
Funny in ways that feel sincere,<br>
The kind that pulls people near.
</p>

<p>
You love with warmth, you stay, you try,<br>
You listen close, you never pass by.<br>
In small, kind acts you always show<br>
How deeply caring hearts can glow.
</p>

<p>
You brighten the room with laughter loud,<br>
Yet hold space gently in every crowd.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>
