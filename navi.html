<h1>For Navi 🎄</h1>

<p>
You feel like laughter that finds its way back,<br>
Like light that sneaks through every crack.<br>
Funny in ways that lift the mood,<br>
Kind at heart, steady and true.
</p>

<p>
You care deeply, you show up strong,<br>
Brave enough to keep moving along.<br>
When things get hard, you do not fold,<br>
You face the world with courage bold.
</p>

<p>
There’s creativity in all you do,<br>
A spark that makes things feel brand new.<br>
You bring color where things feel gray,<br>
Turning ordinary moments bright each day.
</p>

<p>
Strong in spirit, gentle too,<br>
The world feels warmer knowing you.<br>
I’m grateful for your heart so rare,<br>
For the joy and strength you always share.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>
