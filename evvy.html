<h1>For Evvy 🎄</h1>

<p>
You feel like kindness spoken softly,<br>
Like warmth that never asks for more.<br>
Gentle in the way you care,<br>
Yet stronger than you know for sure.
</p>

<p>
You love with patience, sweet and true,<br>
A steady heart in all you do.<br>
There’s bravery behind your calm,<br>
A quiet strength that feels like balm.
</p>

<p>
Smart in ways that go unseen,<br>
Thoughtful, talented, serene.<br>
You shine without needing the light,<br>
Soft presence, powerful might.
</p>

<p>
Being near you feels like peace,<br>
Like worries slowly start to cease.<br>
I’m grateful for your heart, so steady,<br>
So kind, so strong, so always ready.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>

<div class="letter">
  <p><strong>Hi, Evvy.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Thank you for always being there for me.
    Thank you for caring.
  </p>

  <p>
    You have such a gentle way of showing love.
    It’s in the way you listen,
    the way you stay,
    and the way you make people feel seen
    without asking for anything in return.
    Being around you feels safe and warm,
    like I can slow down and just exist.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’re so kind and sweet,
    but there’s also so much strength in you.
    You’re brave in quiet ways,
    strong without being harsh,
    and intelligent in a way that feels calm and steady.
    Your softness is not weakness.
    It’s one of the most powerful things about you.
  </p>

  <p>
    You amaze me with how thoughtful and talented you are.
    You handle things with grace,
    even when they’re hard,
    and you never stop being caring or gentle through it all.
    That says so much about your heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being you.<br>
    Thank you for your care.<br>
    I’m really grateful to have you in my life.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Love,</strong><br>
    Mother.
