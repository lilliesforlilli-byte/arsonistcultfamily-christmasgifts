  <p><strong>Hi, Litara.</strong></p>

  <p>
    I know I don’t know you that well,
    but from what I’ve gathered,
    you’re very funny, kind, talented, and creative.
  </p>

  <p>
    There’s something really warm about the way you come across.
    You have this easy humor and a gentle presence
    that makes people feel comfortable around you.
    Even in small moments, you leave a good impression,
    and that says a lot about who you are.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your creativity stands out in such a natural way.
    It feels effortless,
    like something that’s just part of you.
    I really admire that,
    and I think it’s something special you carry with you.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m glad I get to know you,
    even a little.
    You seem like someone who brings light and kindness
    wherever you go,
    and I hope you always remember that.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being you.<br>
    Wishing you warmth, joy, and many bright moments ahead.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Love,</strong><br>
    Lilly.
