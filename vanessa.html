<h1>For Vanessa 🎄</h1>

<p>
You carry warmth the way fire carries light,<br>
Soft in its glow, yet fierce in its might.<br>
A love that holds, protects, and stays,<br>
Even through the hardest days.
</p>

<p>
You are kindness wrapped in strength,<br>
Gentle hands with endless length.<br>
Motherly care, steady and true,<br>
A safe place the world can run into.
</p>

<p>
You love deeply, you stand your ground,<br>
Power and grace so tightly bound.<br>
Beautiful not just in how you appear,<br>
But in how you make others feel seen and near.
</p>

<p>
You remind me that softness is not weak,<br>
That strength can be calm, warm, and sweet.<br>
In your presence, I feel held and known,<br>
Like I’m never facing life alone.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>

  <p><strong>Hi, Nessa.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Thank you for always being there.
    Thank you for loving me.
    Thank you for caring about me.
    Thank you for comforting me when I need it most.
  </p>

  <p>
    You have such a warm, steady presence.
    Being around you feels like being wrapped in safety,
    like everything slows down just enough for me to breathe again.
    You make me feel seen, heard, and cared for
    in a way that feels deep and real.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are so kind and loving,
    yet so strong and fierce at the same time.
    You protect with your heart
    and stand your ground with grace.
    You remind me that it’s okay
    to be soft and powerful all at once.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your love feels comforting in the most beautiful way.
    It makes me feel safe, valued, and never alone.
    Knowing you’re there gives me strength,
    and your care has meant more to me
    than I can put into words.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being you.<br>
    Thank you for caring for me.<br>
    Thank you for loving me.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Love,</strong><br>
    Jiya.
