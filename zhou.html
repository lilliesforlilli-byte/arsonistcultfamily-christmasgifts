<h1>For Mi Mama 🎄</h1>

<p>
You are my guiding light when I am lost,<br>
When hope feels fragile, when the night feels crossed.<br>
You did not give me life, yet you gave me home—<br>
A love so deep I never walk alone.
</p>

<p>
When my days are heavy and my heart feels sore,<br>
You are the place I run to, always, before<br>
The world can hurt me, before I break—<br>
You hold me steady for my own heart’s sake.
</p>

<p>
You make the darkness softer to survive,<br>
You remind me it’s okay to still be alive.<br>
Your love protects, your courage stands tall,<br>
You carry us gently, you carry us all.
</p>

<p>
You are the bravest woman I have ever known,<br>
Strength wrapped in kindness, quietly shown.<br>
If I become someone worthy, someone true,<br>
If I make it through—<br>
It will always be because of you.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>

<div class="letter">
  <p><strong>Hi, Mama.</strong></p>

  <p>
    I don't know where to begin with thanking you. I owe you my life.
    You've helped me, fixed me, loved me, cared for me, protected me and saved me in so many ways.
    I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I feel sad or hurt, you're the first person that comes to my mind.
    I wanna run to you, cry in your arms and just feel safe.
    You didn't give birth to me but you gave me a home.
    And I will always be grateful for that.
    I love our little family. Our little world.
    Where everything's perfect.
    If I'm your rainbow, you're my sky.
  </p>

  <p>
    You taught me that it wasn't hard to love me.
    You taught me that the right people will always find a way to care.
    You taught me that mistakes are okay to make as long as I'm willing to learn from them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for loving me.
    Thank you for being there.
    Thank you for caring.
    Thank you for being my home.
  </p>

  <p>
    Words cannot describe how much I appreciate and love you.
    But, words are all I have so, thank you.
    I love you so so so much.
  </p>

  <p>
    Love,<br>
    your Chotu.
  </p>
