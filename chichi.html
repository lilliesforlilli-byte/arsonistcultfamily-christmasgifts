<h1>For Papa 🎄</h1>

<p>
You feel like safety without walls,<br>
Like steady ground when everything falls.<br>
When the world is loud and breaking apart,<br>
You calm the storm inside my heart.
</p>

<p>
There’s a peace in the way you exist,<br>
Like nature reminding me I’ll persist.<br>
Even when everything feels unsure,<br>
You make it feel like we’ll endure.
</p>

<p>
You protect without needing to speak,<br>
Strong in silence, gentle, not weak.<br>
A father in all the ways that matter,<br>
Holding me steady when things shatter.
</p>

<p>
Talented hands, a thoughtful mind,<br>
Determined steps, always kind.<br>
No matter what life throws your way,<br>
You smile through it all—you stay.
</p>

<p>
And in that smile, I somehow know,<br>
That everything’s going to be okay, somehow.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>

  <p><strong>Hi, Dad.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Thank you so much for always being there for me.
    Thank you for taking care of me.
    Thank you for cheering me up when I was down.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's something about you that's so calming.
    You make me feel like everything's gonna be okay even if the world feels like it's crumbling down.
    You're always so uplifting, motivated, strong, brave, caring and calm.
  </p>

  <p>
    You make me laugh even when I'm feeling low.
    You're so ridiculously smart, knowledgeable and wise (and old).
  </p>

  <p>
    You've showed me that love doesn't come with anger.
    You've taught me that it's okay to fall down and take a moment to get back up.
    Your positivity is so infectious.
  </p>

  <p>
    I can't thank you enough for everything you've done for me.
    I love you so much.
  </p>

  <p>
    Love,<br>
    your Rat Child.
  </p>
