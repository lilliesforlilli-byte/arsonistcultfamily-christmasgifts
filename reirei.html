<h1>For Reirei 🎄</h1>

<p>
You feel like laughter that comes so easy,<br>
Like bright moments that never feel cheesy.<br>
You light up rooms just being you,<br>
With kindness, care, and a creative view.
</p>

<p>
Funny in ways that lift me high,<br>
Gentle enough to hear my sigh.<br>
You know when to joke, when to stay,<br>
When to make the heavy fade away.
</p>

<p>
There’s beauty in how you see the world,<br>
In every idea you’ve unfurled.<br>
Creative heart, caring soul,<br>
You somehow always make me whole.
</p>

<p>
My partner in crime, a constant cheer,<br>
Thank you of making this a brighter year
</p>

<p>🤍</p>

  <p><strong>Hi, Reirei.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being there for me.
    Thank you for making me laugh.
    Thank you for being an amazing friend.
  </p>

  <p>
    You bring so much joy just by being you.
    Your humor makes even the dullest days brighter,
    and you makes everything feel lighter.
    You know how to turn moments into memories
    without even trying.
  </p>

  <p>
    You care in ways that feel effortless and real.
    You listen, you understand, and you show up
    when it matters.
    Being around you feels joyful and fun
    at the same time,
    like I can be completely myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your creativity amazes me.
    The way you see the world,
    the way your mind works,
    the way you bring beauty into things
    is so wonderful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for being there.<br>
    Thank you for all the laughter and bright moments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Love,</strong><br>
    your Partner in Crime.
