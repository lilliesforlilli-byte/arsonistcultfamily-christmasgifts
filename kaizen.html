<h1>For Kaizen 🎄</h1>

<p>
You feel like comfort mixed with laughter,<br>
The kind that makes moments feel lighter.<br>
Funny in ways that come so easy,<br>
Patient, kind, never rushed or uneasy.
</p>

<p>
You care deeply, and it truly shows,<br>
In how you stay, in how you show up close.<br>
The people you love matter to you,<br>
And you make sure they feel it too.
</p>

<p>
You bring warmth into every space,<br>
With quiet care and an open face.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>

  <p><strong>Hi, Brother in Law.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Thank you for the laughter.
    Thank you for caring.
    Thank you for taking care of my brother
    and making him happy.
  </p>

  <p>
    It really means a lot to me to see how much you care
    about the people in your life.
    You show up with patience, kindness,
    and a good heart,
    and it never goes unnoticed.
    Being around you feels easy and comfortable,
    like you naturally make spaces lighter
    just by being there.
  </p>

  <p>
    You bring warmth and joy in such a simple, real way.
    You’re fun to be around,
    but you’re also steady and thoughtful,
    and that balance is something
    I really appreciate about you.
    It’s clear how much love you have to give,
    and how genuinely you give it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m really glad you’re part of my family.
    Knowing that my brother has someone like you
    by his side makes me happy and grateful.
    Thank you for being you
    and for all the care you bring with you.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Love,</strong><br>
    your Sister in Law.
