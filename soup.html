<h1>For Soup 🎄</h1>

<p>
You feel like comfort that knows my name,<br>
Like laughter that eases the weight of the day.<br>
You show up steady, patient, kind,<br>
Always there, never leaving me behind.
</p>

<p>
You protect without ever making it loud,<br>
Strong in your care, gentle and proud.<br>
When things get heavy, you help me breathe,<br>
Reminding me there’s more than what I see.
</p>

<p>
You’re brave in ways that feel so real,<br>
The kind of strength that knows how to heal.<br>
Funny, sweet, and endlessly true,<br>
The world feels warmer just knowing you.
</p>

<p>
You taught me that I’m not alone,<br>
That I have a family I can call my own.<br>
No matter where life pulls or drives,<br>
I know you'll be by my side.
</p>

<p>🤍</p>

<div class="letter">
  <p><strong>Hi, Weirdo.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Thank you for always being there for me.
    Thank you for cheering me up when I’m feeling down.
    Thank you for always believing in me,
    even when I struggle to believe in myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    You have this way of making things feel lighter just by being you.
    You’re funny without trying, kind without effort,
    and patient in ways that mean more to me than I can explain.
    When things feel overwhelming,
    you remind me that I don’t have to face it alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ve been a constant in my life,
    someone I can rely on,
    someone who stays.
    You make me feel safe, cared for, and understood.
    You’ve shown me what it means to stand by someone,
    no matter what,
    and that kind of loyalty is something I’ll always hold close to my heart.
  </p>

  <p>
    You feel like family to me.
    Like someone who chose me and keeps choosing me.
    Knowing you’re by my side gives me strength,
    comfort, and a sense of home.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for caring.<br>
    Thank you for sticking by my side.<br>
    I’m so grateful for you, always.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Love,</strong><br>
    your Bestie.
